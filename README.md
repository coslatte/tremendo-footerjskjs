## Slaudos

This is my very first website (para los que no saben inglés: buenos días hoy es viernes).

Made with bootstrap 5.3, this is my really first thing built with my bare hands and a bit of use of AI to speed my research.
Learn bunch of stuff on the way, things that I wouldn't even imagine I would be even able to do in one single day.
Idk... it was really fun :D

anyway, the page is in Spanish, but the main objective is calculating oversities values using weith and how tall the person is: [wikikpedia-article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index).

It was challenging because that JavaScript code right there dude, thats my 1rs js code ever writen dude, no clue (it was easy....... FOR NOW muahah, na fr, shit's gonna be tough).

Project totally having fun and for the sake of learning.

peace ⭐
