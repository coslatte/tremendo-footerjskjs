## Slaudos

This is my very first website (para los que no saben inglés: buenos días hoy es viernes).

Made with bootstrap 5.3, this is my really first web thing built with my bare hands and a bit of use of AI to speed up my research.
Learned bunch of stuff on the way, things that I wouldn't even imagine I would be even able to do in one single day.
Idk... it was really fun :D

anyway, the page is in Spanish, but the main objective is calculating obesity values using weigth (kg) and how tall the person is in meters: [wikikpedia-article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index).

It was challenging because that JavaScript code right there dude, that's my 1rs js code ever writen dude, no clue still how tf i made it (it was easy to make....... FOR NOW muahah, na fr, shit's gonna be tough I guess in the future with this type of stuff).

Project totally having fun and for the sake of learning.

peace ⭐
